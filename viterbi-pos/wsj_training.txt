Let/VERB us/PRON now/ADV regard/VERB D/NOUN as/ADP a/DET linear/ADJ operator/NOUN on/ADP the/DET subspace/NOUN V/NOUN ./.

If/ADP Af/NOUN is/VERB the/DET null/ADJ space/NOUN of/ADP Af/NOUN ,/. then/ADV Theorem/NOUN 12/NUM says/VERB that/ADP Af/NOUN ./.

In/ADP the/DET f-plane/NOUN the/DET coordinates/NOUN of/ADP the/DET corresponding/ADJ point/NOUN are/VERB Af/NOUN ./.

We/PRON are/VERB saying/VERB that/ADP the/DET pain/NOUN was/VERB bad/ADJ when/ADV and/CONJ as/ADP it/PRON occurred/VERB and/CONJ before/ADP anyone/NOUN took/VERB an/DET attitude/NOUN toward/ADP it/PRON ./.

And/CONJ our/DET question/NOUN is/VERB ,/. is/VERB such/PRT an/DET implication/NOUN consistent/ADJ with/ADP what/DET we/PRON meant/VERB ?/.
Clearly/ADV it/PRON is/VERB not/ADV ./.
If/ADP anyone/NOUN asked/VERB us/PRON ,/. after/ADP we/PRON made/VERB the/DET remark/NOUN that/ADP the/DET suffering/NOUN was/VERB a/DET bad/ADJ thing/NOUN ,/. whether/ADP we/PRON should/VERB think/VERB it/PRON relevant/ADJ to/ADP what/DET we/PRON said/VERB to/PRT learn/VERB that/ADP the/DET incident/NOUN had/VERB never/ADV occurred/VERB and/CONJ no/DET pain/NOUN had/VERB been/VERB suffered/VERB at/ADP all/PRT ,/. we/PRON should/VERB say/VERB that/ADP it/PRON made/VERB all/PRT the/DET difference/NOUN in/ADP the/DET world/NOUN ,/. that/ADP what/DET we/PRON were/VERB asserting/VERB to/PRT be/VERB bad/ADJ was/VERB precisely/ADV the/DET suffering/NOUN we/PRON thought/VERB had/VERB occurred/VERB back/ADV there/ADV ,/. that/ADP if/ADP this/DET had/VERB not/ADV occurred/VERB ,/. there/PRT was/VERB nothing/NOUN left/VERB to/PRT be/VERB bad/ADJ ,/. and/CONJ that/ADP our/DET assertion/NOUN was/VERB in/ADP that/DET case/NOUN mistaken/VERB ./.
The/DET suggestion/NOUN that/ADP in/ADP saying/VERB something/NOUN evil/ADJ had/VERB occurred/VERB we/PRON were/VERB after/ADP all/PRT making/VERB no/DET mistake/NOUN ,/. because/ADP we/PRON had/VERB never/ADV meant/VERB anyhow/ADV to/PRT say/VERB anything/NOUN about/ADP the/DET past/ADJ suffering/NOUN ,/. seems/VERB to/ADP me/PRON merely/ADV frivolous/ADJ ./.
If/ADP we/PRON did/VERB not/ADV mean/VERB to/PRT say/VERB this/DET ,/. why/ADV should/VERB we/PRON be/VERB so/ADV relieved/VERB on/ADP finding/VERB that/ADP the/DET suffering/NOUN had/VERB not/ADV occurred/VERB ?/.
On/ADP the/DET theory/NOUN before/ADP us/PRON ,/. such/ADJ relief/NOUN would/VERB be/VERB groundless/ADJ ,/. for/ADP in/ADP that/DET suffering/NOUN itself/PRON there/PRT was/VERB nothing/NOUN bad/ADJ at/ADP all/PRT ,/. and/CONJ hence/ADV in/ADP its/DET nonoccurrence/NOUN there/PRT would/VERB be/VERB nothing/NOUN to/PRT be/VERB relieved/VERB about/ADP ./.

The/DET pain/NOUN in/ADP itself/PRON was/VERB neutral/ADJ ;/. ;/. but/CONJ unfortunately/ADV the/DET rabbit/NOUN ,/. on/ADP no/DET grounds/NOUN at/ADP all/PRT ,/. took/VERB up/PRT toward/ADP this/DET neutral/ADJ object/NOUN an/DET attitude/NOUN of/ADP disapproval/NOUN and/CONJ that/DET made/VERB it/PRON for/ADP the/DET first/ADJ time/NOUN ,/. and/CONJ in/ADP the/DET only/ADJ intelligible/ADJ sense/NOUN ,/. bad/ADJ ./.
This/DET way/NOUN of/ADP escape/NOUN is/VERB theoretically/ADV possible/ADJ ,/. but/CONJ since/ADP it/PRON has/VERB grave/ADJ difficulties/NOUN of/ADP its/DET own/ADJ and/CONJ has/VERB not/ADV ,/. so/ADV far/ADV as/ADP I/PRON know/VERB ,/. been/VERB urged/VERB by/ADP positivists/NOUN ,/. it/PRON is/VERB perhaps/ADV best/ADJ not/ADV to/PRT spend/VERB time/NOUN over/ADP it/PRON ./.

Fromm/NOUN seems/VERB unaware/ADJ of/ADP these/DET developments/NOUN ./.
Another/DET example/NOUN is/VERB his/DET very/ADV infrequent/ADJ use/NOUN of/ADP the/DET large/ADJ amount/NOUN of/ADP data/NOUN from/ADP surveys/NOUN designed/VERB to/PRT discover/VERB what/DET and/CONJ how/ADV people/NOUN actually/ADV do/VERB feel/VERB and/CONJ think/VERB on/ADP a/DET broad/ADJ range/NOUN of/ADP topics/NOUN :/. he/PRON cites/VERB such/ADJ survey-type/ADJ findings/NOUN just/ADV three/NUM times/NOUN ./.

What/DET matters/NOUN is/VERB that/ADP while/ADP Fromm's/NOUN reading/NOUN of/ADP the/DET data/NOUN is/VERB not/ADV the/DET only/ADJ one/NUM possible/ADJ ,/. it/PRON is/VERB precisely/ADV the/DET one/NUM we/PRON would/VERB expect/VERB from/ADP a/DET writer/NOUN who/PRON earnestly/ADV believes/VERB that/ADP every/DET man/NOUN can/VERB and/CONJ ought/VERB to/PRT be/VERB happy/ADJ and/CONJ satisfied/VERB ./.
Fromm/NOUN also/ADV cites/VERB a/DET poll/NOUN on/ADP attitudes/NOUN toward/ADP work/NOUN restriction/NOUN conducted/VERB by/ADP the/DET Opinion/NOUN Research/NOUN Corporation/NOUN in/ADP 1945/NUM ,/. in/ADP which/DET 49/NUM per/ADP cent/NOUN of/ADP manual/ADJ workers/NOUN said/VERB a/DET man/NOUN ought/VERB to/PRT turn/VERB out/PRT as/ADV much/ADJ as/ADP he/PRON could/VERB in/ADP a/DET day's/NOUN work/NOUN ,/. while/ADP 41/NUM per/ADP cent/NOUN said/VERB he/PRON should/VERB not/ADV do/VERB his/DET best/ADJ but/CONJ should/VERB turn/VERB out/PRT only/ADV the/DET average/ADJ amount/NOUN ./.

The/DET failure/NOUN to/PRT keep/VERB these/DET two/NUM usages/NOUN distinct/ADJ presents/VERB hazards/NOUN to/ADP the/DET reader/NOUN ./.
It/PRON also/ADV permits/VERB Fromm/NOUN to/PRT do/VERB some/DET dubious/ADJ things/NOUN with/ADP empirical/ADJ findings/NOUN ./.
When/ADV alienation/NOUN is/VERB used/VERB as/ADP an/DET objective/ADJ and/CONJ diagnostic/ADJ category/NOUN ,/. for/ADP example/NOUN ,/. it/PRON becomes/VERB clear/ADJ that/ADP Fromm/NOUN would/VERB have/VERB to/PRT say/VERB that/DET awareness/NOUN of/ADP alienation/NOUN goes/VERB far/ADV toward/ADP conquering/VERB it/PRON ./.
